      <p>I am an undergrad at Yale majoring in Statistics & Data Science and Mathematics.
      <!-- I was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa in my junior year. -->
      I plan to graduate in Fall 2024.</p>

      <p>I am broadly interested in inference and learning.
      My research has largely been at the intersection of machine learning and computational neuroscience.
      I have been fortunate to work with <a href="https://statistics.yale.edu/people/john-lafferty">John Lafferty (Yale)</a> and <a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/people/jonathan-cohen">Jonathan Cohen (Princeton)</a> during my summers.
      In Fall 2023, I took time off from school to work as a Project Research Intern at the Gatsby Unit with <a href="https://www.saxelab.org/">Andrew Saxe (UCL)</a>.
      This work was just accepted to NeurIPS 2024 as a spotlight presentation.
      </p>

      <p>
      I am also interested in more classical statistical problems.
      I have worked with <a href="http://www.stat.yale.edu/~yw562/">Yihong Wu (Yale)</a> on studying shuffled linear regression, for which I won the Hartigan Prize from the Yale stats department.
      I recently presented our work at ISIT 2024.</p>
